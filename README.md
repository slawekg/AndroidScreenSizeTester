AndroidScreenSizeTester
=======================
This is a tiny helpful project that shows what's the density and screen size of the given Android device. It does it in 
two ways:
- automatic, showing how Android itself sees the device by showing which files are picked up ( res\values-large etc. and 
    res\drawable-mdpi etc.)
- read the values manually

It also shows the real width and height of the screen.
